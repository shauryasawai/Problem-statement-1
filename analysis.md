## Conclusion

The analysis reveals clear behavioral archetypes that correlate strongly with credit scores. The most successful DeFi users demonstrate:

1. **Patience over greed** - Conservative leverage rather than maximum extraction
2. **Consistency over intensity** - Regular patterns rather than sporadic bursts
3. **Learning over denial** - Adapting behavior after negative events
4. **Diversification over concentration** - Spreading risk across assets/protocols

The scoring system successfully identifies these patterns, providing a reliable framework for assessing DeFi creditworthiness. The clear behavioral differences across score ranges validate the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between responsible and risky wallet behaviors.
